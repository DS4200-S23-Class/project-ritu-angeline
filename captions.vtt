00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:04.739
Our visualization contains an interactive United States map

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:08.007
as well as a bar chart that shows the number of HIPAA breaches by type.

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:17.347
The different types of breaches are Hacking or an IT incident,  Unauthorized Access or Disclosure, Theft, Improper Disposal, and Loss.

00:00:17.513 --> 00:00:24.486
We also created a filter that shows the data by year so the data for 2021, 2022, and 2023.

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.156
So, the way our visualization works is we click on a state.

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:32.926
So, let's say we wanted to see the data for Texas. We will click on Texas.

00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:35.028
And then we will click on the year.

00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:39.242
So, the data for 2021 shows this in the bar chart.

00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:46.246
And it gets updated by year so in 2022 this is the data as well as in 2023

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.740
And if we wanted to see another state's data

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:54.610
Let's say we wanted to use New York. We click on New York.

00:00:55.041 --> 00:01:02.016
And then we would also click on the year  so we can do 2021, 2022, and 2023.

00:01:02.747 --> 00:01:08.021
And if we wanted to see the United States as a whole and the number of breaches by type

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:12.357
we would click anywhere outside of the United States or any white space that's here.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.028
And then we would click by the year so in 2021 this is the amount of breaches.

00:01:17.686 --> 00:01:18.777
In 2022

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.640
As well as in 2023

00:01:22.508 --> 00:01:24.700
This visualization supports two domain tasks.

00:01:25.082 --> 00:01:27.169
The first one would be to conduct a risk assessment.

00:01:27.307 --> 00:01:33.040
At a high level, it would be discover. The visualization will need to be explored by the user to glean any valuable insights.

00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:37.677
At a medium level, it would be browse. The location is already known but the target is unknown.

00:01:37.828 --> 00:01:44.049
At a low level, it would be identify. The visualization will provide information about data breaches in the target location.

00:01:44.447 --> 00:01:47.652
The second domain task is developing a data security strategy.

00:01:47.835 --> 00:01:51.213
At a high level and a medium level, it would be the same as the first domain task.

00:01:51.713 --> 00:01:58.121
But at a low level, it would be summarize. The visualization will provide information about data breaches by a state and its associated information

00:01:58.121 --> 00:02:03.564
such as how the information was breached, where the breaches occurred, the amount of breaches, and when the data was breached.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.967
to help the end user develop data security regulations and practices.
